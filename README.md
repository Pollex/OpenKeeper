# OpenKeeper

OpenKeeper is a tool for generating ORY Oathkeeper rules from various sources, such as OpenAPI specifications and TOML files. It provides a convenient way to define and manage access control rules for your APIs.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/pollex/openkeeper@latest
```

## Usage

To generate a ruleset, use the `generate` command with a config file:

```
openkeeper generate --config config.toml
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is a TOML file that defines the sources and settings for generating the rules. Here's an example:

```toml
# Setup the noop authenticator
[Oathkeeper.Authenticators.Noop]
Handler = "noop"

# Setup the noop mutator
[Oathkeeper.Mutators.Noop]
Handler = "noop"

[openapi3.PetStoreExample]
File = "petstore.yaml"
Domains = ["https://pet.store.com/api"]

[toml.ExtraRules]
File = "rules.toml"
Domains = ["https://auth.pet.store.com"]
```

### OpenAPI 3

To specify what handler to use per SecurityScheme, use the `x-oathkeeper-authenticator` extension field:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    CookieSession:
      type: apiKey
      in: cookie
      name: SID
      x-oathkeeper-authenticator: cookie_session
    APIKey:
      type: http
      scheme: Bearer
      x-oathkeeper-authenticator: bearer_token
```

To specify what mutators to apply, use the `x-oathkeeper-mutator` extension field. Either on the root-level to define a default, or per operation:

```yaml
x-oathkeeper-mutators:
  - Hydrate
  - IDToken
```

The given entries for x-oathkeeper-authenticator and x-oathkeeper-mutator must be defined in the config.toml file. 

### TOML Rules

Rules can also be specified in TOML, such as the one below:

```toml
[Rules.Dashboard]
Description = "Dashboard (sub)paths"
Authenticators = ["CookieSession"]
Mutators = ["Hydrate", "IDToken"]
Path = "/dashboard<(/.+)?>"
Methods = ["GET","POST","PATCH","PUT","DELETE","OPTION"]

[Rules."InternalTraffic"]
Description = "Internal traffic should already contains JWT"
Domains = ["http://a.different.domain.for.this.one"]
Authenticators = ["Noop"]
Mutators = ["Noop"]
Path = "/<.*>"
Methods = ["GET","POST","PATCH","PUT","DELETE","OPTION"]
```

## Development

A transformer is given an `oathkeeper.Context` struct which contains information about what Oathkeeper Handlers (Authenticators, Authorizer, Mutators and Error) are available.
